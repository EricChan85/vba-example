Quick Macro require in VBA for Excel. Must work in 2000 onwards.

Requirement is to convert 3 rows in to one row. This needs to be flexible in terms of the number of rows that need to be converted in to one row via a popup. Solution will be

1) Select the rows that need converting.
2) Start the Macro
3) Popup appears asking for number of rows that need converting to one
4) User enters e.g. 3
5) Rows are converted to 1 row.
